## Specification
In regards to project description, details are explained in [*`Project.pdf`*](https://github.com/melmarsezio/Microprocessors-and-Interfacing/blob/master/Smart%20Airplane%20Window%20Controller/Project.pdf)  
A project instruction manual is also provided: [*`Project Instruction Manual.pdf`*](https://github.com/melmarsezio/Microprocessors-and-Interfacing/blob/master/Smart%20Airplane%20Window%20Controller/Project%20Instruction%20Manual.pdf)  

Generally, we have Push bottom, Keypads to control the opaque level of plane windows by emergency/ central pilot/ passanger. The opaque level is represented by the LED brightness (fully on -> fully opaque, fully off -> transparent). Each window of different passangers are independent, they are only synchronized when emergency happens or pilot indicates to do so (either fully opaque or fully clear depend on the situation). Windows might set to clear when preparing for landing, and set to dark when passangers are resting.
